NSG - Network security grp that acts as a virtual firewall, filtering the inbound and outbound network traffic

NFR vs FR

fr (functional requirements) - Features, behaviors, or services the system must provide.

nfr (non-functional requirements) - Qualities or constraints of the system.

tactics of nfr 
	Performance - The system should respond quickly and handle expected loads.
	Scalability - The system can grow (up or out) to handle increased traffic/data.
	Availability - The system should be up and running with minimal downtime.
	Reliability - The system performs consistently and correctly over time.
	Usability - The system is easy to use, intuitive, and user-friendly.
	Maintainability - The system can be easily updated, fixed, or improved.
	Portability - The system can run on different platforms or environments.
	Interoperability - The system can work well with other systems and services.
	Testability - The system can be easily tested for correctness and quality.
	Compliance - The system follows laws, regulations, and standards.

image cache - Docker saves time during builds by reusing previously built layers instead of rebuilding everything from scratch - only in compile time not at run time.

types of scale in Kubernetes
	* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)	
	define - Automatically adds/removes pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.	
	eg - Web app scales from 2 pods to 5 during high traffic.
	* Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)	
	define - Automatically adjusts CPU/memory resources of pods (not number of pods).	
	eg - Increases memory limit of a pod from 256Mi to 512Mi.
	* Cluster Autoscaler (CA)	
	define - Automatically adds/removes nodes in the cluster based on pod scheduling needs.	
	eg - Adds a new VM/node when pods can't fit due to resource limits.



bastion host - acts like a door / people which correct pem file can access to ip...which means they should have listed ips to enter the bastion host. (You have a private VM in an Azure VNet or AWS VPC with no public IP.Without Bastion:
	* You can't SSH into it from your laptop.
	* Exposing a public IP is risky.

bastion host -- secure gateway server used to access private resources (like VMs) in a protected network.
You connect to the Bastion, and then from there, you can connect to your private servers — instead of exposing them directly to the internet.


vnet--service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. -- can be for particular area not all over the nation. 

vpc

________

tech-1 ---> vnet (main)

tech-2

info1 ---> subnet 

_________

regions - geographical area where physical datacenter are available.
availability zones -  its own mini data center with independent: Power , Cooling , Networking.

deployment models.

*Public - owned and operated by third-party cloud providers
	- Low cost, No hardware maintenance, fast to deploy
*Private - used exclusively by one organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party, but is fully dedicated to a single tenant.
	- Greater security and control
*Hybrid - combines public and private clouds, allowing data and apps to be shared between them.
	- Balances cost and control

______________________

vpc/vnet peering- allows two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to communicate with each other privately using private IP addresses, without going over the public internet.it should have diff range of ip address.

Good Peering Example
	VNet A: 10.1.0.0/16
	VNet B: 10.2.0.0/16
No overlap — peering works fine

if ip looks- 10.1.1.0/24 --> like this it works...it may overlap.

why we r using peering..advantages an disadvantages.
	* costly without peering
	* security
	* latency	

__________________________


vm scale set - different service - auto scaling will happens ---where resource increase ..it should define with loadbalancer.

availability set - fault domain --- azure says that it will distribute vm across multiple fault domain.
